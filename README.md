## django-project-template

django-project-template is a Django 1.6+ project template, giving you a skeleton web application with some useful, but general, features. 

### Features

+ Separate dev, stag, and prod environments.
    + cleanly separates settings and requirements
    + switch environments easily based on APP_ENV env var.
+ [django-storages](http://django-storages.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) static asset storage backend integration with S3.
+ Environment variable based database configuration
    + [dj-database-url](https://github.com/kennethreitz/dj-database-url) configures the database from the DATABASE_URL env var.
    + database passwords kept in environment variables and out of source.
    + integrates with Amazon RDS, Heroku DBs, and others easily.
+ Deployable directly to Heroku.
+ Helps you construct organized web applications that follow the [12factor](http://12factor.net/) methodology.
+ Default project 404 and 500 error pages. 

### Usage

Create a virtual environment in which to install Django and other pip packages. See [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) or [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/))

    workon django-myproj  # activate a virtualenvwrapper virtualenv
    pip install django

If you have git cloned [django-project-template](https://github.com/dghubble/django-project-template),

    django-admin.py startproject \
    --template=/path/to/django-project-template \
    --extension py,md,html myproj

otherwise,

    django-admin.py startproject \
    --template=https://github.com/dghubble/django-project-template/zipball/master \
    --extension py,md,html myproj

A *myproj* project directory containing a README.md, a manage.py script, and a *myproj* Python package directory was created. Rename the outer (project) directory to anything you wish, but don't modify the inner (package) directory or package name.

    mv myproj convenient-name   # optional

Navigate into the project directory. For all of the remaining instructions, you should be located inside the project directory.

#### Select Project Database

django-project-template encourages use of MySQL or PostgreSQL in development, for greater parity with the staging and production environments. Install and configure either MySQL([guide]()) or PostgreSQL([guide]()) on your local machine if you have not already done so. Next remove dependencies that are commented, with databases you are not using, from the requirements files. Also, in your project's README.md file, under `Machine Prep`, remove mention of any databases you are not using.

Open the settings.py file within your project package directory and uncomment one of the MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite settings sections within DATABASES. Check that the default database url string (e.g. mysql://username:password@localhost:3306/django_myproj) has the correct scheme, username, password, port, and database name.

django-project-template allows storing local database authentication credentials in source code since in development environments, throw-away database accounts and databases are frequently used. However, if this is a concern, remove the default keyword argument to `dj_database_url.config` entirely so the database used by the Django project is configured by the DATABASE_URL environment variable alone.

### Continuing

The django-project-template README is divided into 2 parts. The first, which includes this and prior sections, describes how to generate a Django project from the template. The later part is a skeleton for the README of your generated project - it is personalized for your project so instead of {% templatetag openblock %} project_name {% templatetag closeblock %} blocks, your project name will be used instead. 

If you haven't already, switch to the README.md file generated inside your personal Django project and continue following the directions there, from this point. 

Once you develop your project a little further, you may delete the first part of this README so it can focus on describing your Django project, shwoing how to setup the project, etc. 


## {{project_name}} Project

### Overview

{{project_name}} ...

### Machine Prep

If you haven't already, install and configure MySQL on your local machine ([guide]()). 
If you haven't already, install and configure PostgreSQL on your local machine ([guide]()). 

Create a database user and database django_{{project_name}} to use for {{project_name}} development. Ensure the database url string under DATABASES in {{project_name}}/settings.py corresponds to your setup.

### Project Setup

Create a virtual environment in which to install Python pip packages. Virtual environment activation with [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv),

    virtualenv venv            # create virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # activate 

or with [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/),

    mkvirtualenv django-myproj # create and activate environment
    workon django-myproj       # reactivate existing environment

Install development dependencies,

    pip install -r requirements/development.txt

Setup database tables,

    python manage.py syncdb    # create neccessary tables

Run the web application locally,

    python manage.py runserver # 127.0.0.1:8000


### Adding Apps

Projects templated from django-project-template are designed so that reusable apps you include source code for can be placed adjacent to the project's package directory {{project_name}}. Add the (unprefixed) app names to {{project_name}}/settings.py INSTALLED_APPS. The `static` and `templates` directories of your included apps should use inner directories that match the name of the app for namespacing.

Start creating included source reusable Django apps with

    python manage.py startapp appname



### Workflow


#### Environments

Switch environments by changing the value of the APP_ENV environment variable.

The `development` or `dev` environment runs the Django application with DEBUG set to true on a small development server which auto-reloads changed files. Django trackbacks are shown instead of error pages. Django itself serves the static assets located inside your project and apps. The database you have created on your local machine is used

The `staging` or `stag` environment can be run both locally or deployed because it includes both in ALLOWED_HOSTS. If deployed, the staging deployment should be separate from the production deployment (e.g. different Heroku application). The staging environment uses production type deployed static assets and databases though the actual hosted assets use a different S3 bucket from production and the staging database should be separate from the production database. Authentication keys or credentials are kept in environment variables, not in source.

Typically, when moving from `development` to `staging`, first switch to the staging environment locally and run the project with manage.py's runserver to test whether interactions with production type static assets and databases works without issue. Staging deployments should use production type webservers so that `staging` is identical to `production` except for the names of buckets, dbs, etc.

The `production` or `prod` environment is the environment in which your application should run in the real world. All authentication keys or credentials are kept in environment variables, not in source. The project should be served by a production quality webserver such as [gunicorn](http://gunicorn.org/). Static assets should be served from a a globally available file store (S3) or CDN. Production databases should be backed up and fortified. Production static asset stores and databases should be touched with extreme caution.


#### Static Resources

In development, static assets are hosted at '<base_url>/static/' + namespacing appname + path to the asset within the 'myapp/static/myapp' directory. In your templates, include {% templatetag openblock %} load staticfiles {% templatetag closeblock %} at the top of the template and reference static assets like,

    <img src="{% templatetag openblock %} static 'appname/img/myimage.png' {% templatetag closeblock %}" alt="myimage">

{{project_name}} uses the standard `django.contrib.staticfiles` app so in development, when the DEBUG setting is true, static assets are served automatically with runserver. 


#### Deploying Static Resources

In staging and production environments, using a web process to serve static assets is not appropriate. {{project_name}} uses `django-storages` adapters to upload collected static assets to Amazon S3 and to replace static template tags correctly.

First, create [S3 buckets](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3) django_{{project_name}}_static and django_{{project_name}}_static_staging (set in {{project_name}}/settings/staging.py and {{project_name}}/settings/production.py) for static assets. Then create an [IAM](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) user django_{{project_name}} with the Full S3 Access permission policy.

Be sure the APP_ENV, SECRET_KEY, AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY environment variables are set in your environment.

Upload static files,

    python manage.py collectstatic  # when APP_ENV is staging or production

Then, in staging and production, the static assets uploaded to the staging and production buckets, respectively, will be referenced in your templates.

*Note: If a STATIC_ROOT directory was created in your project directory, your APP_ENV is set to development. Delete the STATIC_ROOT directory.*



### Deployment


#### Heroku

Customize the ALLOWED_HOSTS in {{project_name}}/settings/staging.py and {{project_name}}/settings/production.py.
